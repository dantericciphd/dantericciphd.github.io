# Brew Log
  
  + ## üç∫ DR Brew **25.001**: Oak Barrel [Kolsch](https://oakbarrel.com/ingredient-kolsch-ale/)
  
    + ### ü§î Brew Day Prep
  
      + Oak Barrel has two brew kits that seem appropriate.  I did their Kolsch previously; I will buy both.  I have helpful [notes from last time](https://share.evernote.com/note/f7057000-abe5-c888-2408-ee0478a7b4b2) on the Kolsch.
  
        + [Blonde Ale](https://oakbarrel.com/ingredient-kit-blonde-ale/)
  
          + I got this kit (and the Kolsch) from Oak Barrel on [[Jul 5th, 2025]].  Called for 4 lbs Pilsen (very light extract) and 2 lb Munich (darker extract).  They're out of Pilsen liquid, so she gave me [their Golden Light liquid extract](https://oakbarrel.com/light-liquid-malt/) instead. Final product will be less light that the original recipe intended.

          + [Evernote entry from 2022 attempt - contains detailed notes](https://share.evernote.com/note/f7057000-abe5-c888-2408-ee0478a7b4b2)
  
          + Oak Barrel was out of Pilsen liquid extract, so I got 6 lbs of [their dry Pilsen extract](https://oakbarrel.com/dry-malt-extract-pilsner/)

      + There are a bunch of things I'll need to for ^^**Brew Day Prep**^^, especially since it's been a while:
  
          + Ss Brewtech kettle and lid
  
            + any last things I can try to keep the temp gauge attached?  the problem is the leaking, presumably there are gaskets I haven't tried
  
            + confirm water tight!
  
            + be sure to include trub dam
  
          + Wort chiller
  
          + tubing
  
          + fermentation tank (especially spigot)
  
            + confirm water tight!
  
          + airlock
  
          + tongs
  
          + spatula
  
      + **Wort prep (brewing)**
  
        + use less water than recommended - when i used 6.5 gal last time it was too much, try 6 gal, maybe even less depending on how much sparge water you use.
  
          + remember that you can always do a partial boil - maybe 4 or even 5 gals, then top off to replace the water that boiled off as you're beginning the cool.  the problem is that this does impact the wort relative to a full boil and may benefit from some accommodations (including staging the use of malt extract).  maybe best to do full boil, just use less.
  
          + instead of going from fridge to kettle which required complex engineering and hauling the kettle, use existing mineral water and fill empty or partially empty containers with fridge filtered water.
  
      + **Fermentation**
  
        + Important question: Do I want to use the conical fermenter again??
  
          + It's simpler, but I haven't had great luck with outcome s. Am I better off using a more traditional approach?
  
          + I read some Reddit threads and learned of an alternative fermenter that people seem to like that still offers a spigot (with dip tube and thermowell) for easier kegging without the hassle of the conical setup and footprint.  I just went ahead and ordered it - if nothing else, I'd like to have the option to have a second fermentation going, and don't want to bother with the glass carboy if I don't have to.
  
          + After reading additional guidance online, I think what I'm going to do is ^^**use the conical**^^ and simply **avoid removing the elbow and dumping the yeast** - what's the point, especially if all the yeast collects there?  Better, perhaps, to just do primary and to close off the ball valve between the vessels after the yeast has all crashed out.
  
      + 
  
    + ### üìù Brew Day Notes ([[Jul 5th, 2025]])
  
      + **Liquid yeast**
  
        + Took pack out of fridge at 8:30a
  
        + Activated around 11am
  
      + **Water**
  
        + **Volumes**
  
          + The 20L line seems equivalent to 5gal based on pouring in water of known volume.  adding a 6th gallon brings the waterline to between 6g and 25L.
  
          + 5 gallons in:
  
![image.png](/assets/image_1751865899585_0.png)
  
          + 6 gallons in:
  
![image.png](/assets/image_1751865927301_0.png)
  
        + I used 2.5gal of Arrowhead mineral spring water, and 3.5gal of filtered fridge water as my initial volume (6gal)
  
      + **Steep**
  
        + Removed bag when temp just over 160F.  Sparged with hot water from kettle, tried to be conservative - brought final vol to 25L.  Sparge water was mostly clear.
  
      + **Boil**
  
        + Cut heat when reached boiling temp (and was boiling gently)
  
        + Added DME
  
          + Without a doubt, this part's tricky. The DME starts clumping immediately - just the steam from the boil is enough to clump the extract at the edge of the bag.
  
          + STOP STIRRING before you pour - else, you'll get DME on the spatula, and it will cake
  
          + POUR DELIBERATELY INTO THE CENTER - it's too easy to get some on the sides above the water line; can cake onto the kettle wll
  
            + pour incrementally - maybe 2-3 pours per 3lb bag
  
        + Added FermCap at beginning of boil after adding DME - no hot break!  Worked like a charm.
  
        + Added bittering hops once reached boil again.  NOTE: Hellertau hops provided, different from what was called for in recipe (i.e. Vanguard)
  
        + **Hops Note:**
  
          + these are the hops they provided - not same as recipe sheet
  
![image.png](/assets/image_1751865856142_0.png)
  
        + Set timer for 45' (brings me to next step, i.e. irish moss addition)
  
        + Crushed irish moss with a hammer inside its baggie (not sure if this is necessary, but i did it) and added with 15' left in boil
  
          + spilled ~ half (maybe a little less) on the floor, so got a half tablet in.  seems appropriate as recipes have regularly called for 1/2 tab.
  
![image.png](/assets/image_1751866168553_0.png)
  
        + Added the wort chiller to the boil with 10 mins left (to sterilize)
  
        + Added yeast nutrient with 10' remaining (opened capsule first)
  
        + Ended boil promptly at 60'.  Did not confirm the volume, but I believe it was at or very close to the 20L mark.
  
      + **Wort chill**
  
![image.png](/assets/image_1751866003256_0.png)
  
![image.png](/assets/image_1751866061386_0.png)
  
        + Took ~20 minutes to get down to 80F.  Longer than expected.
  
        + See **Ups and Downs** regarding a tubing disconnect incident
  
        + Made sure to get to 80F, then let things sit both to settle and to cool a bit more - goal was to wait to pitch until close to 70F.
  
        + I didn't explicitly bother with whirlpooling, but I did frequently stir the wort with the chiller to hasten cooling.
  
      + **Fermentation**
  
        + Sterilized funnel, screen, and airlock with boiling water and star san
  
        + Sterilized the FastFerment conical with PBW
  
          + rinsed w/ hot water
  
        + transferred wort (after trub settling) through spigot with kettle on bench and conical in stand on floor.
  
          + only opened part-way, at least at first, to avoid disturbing the trub
  
        + Moved filled fermenter to closet in guest room
  
        + Sterilized yeast pack, tore open, and poured contents into fermenter (around 3:30-4p, i.e. roughly 5 hours after activation)
  
        + OG not known - broken hydrometer.
  
      + **Ups and Downs**
  
        + üëç Fermcap applied right away as approaching boil temp - avoided foaming all together.
  
        + üëç Using the gold bung in the faucet fitting worked great, even though it couldn't insert completely.  Keep it simple.
  
        + üëç I let the wort settle for 3-5 minutes on the bench after the chilling ended.  ^^This was huge.^^  Everything solid settled at bottom below the level of the dipstick, and the wort came out beautifully clear - barely any residue on the screen, even.  And this was without the trub dam!
  
![image.png](/assets/image_1751866122717_0.png)
  
        + üëé I forgot to install the trub dam and didn't realize until I started the steep that it wasn't there.  Turned out not to be a problem at all (see line above).
  
        + üëé I learned the hard way that you can't sterilize an airlock in hot water - I melted one of mine doing that!
  
        + üëé Chill took longer than expected (20 mins) - may want to consider methods to expedite, including:
  
          + place the input tubing in an ice water bath (maybe use very long tubing?)
background-color:: green
  
          + wrap the kettle in a cold wet towel
background-color:: green
  
        + üëé There was an incident during wort chilling - one of the tubes (input) slipped off the chiller port and started to spray; some likely ended up in the beer, probably a very small amount.  After this, I tightened the worm clamps on the tubes to make sure they're water tight.
  
        + üëé I dropped my hydrometer and broke it!
  
        + üëé I had the O2 tank and diffusion stone, but no connector to draw the O2 and connect  tubing.  Bought one today on Amazon, will be ready for next week.
  
        + 
  
    + ### üö∞ Kegging Day ([[Jul 20th, 2025]])
  
      + **Misc Notes**
  
        + Helpful [guide to using DuoTight quick-disconnect fittings](https://www.homebrewfinds.com/hands-on-review-kegland-duotight-fittings-evabarrier-tubing/)
  
        + cleaned keg and tubing:
  
          + dumped contents, rinsed multiple times with a gallon or so of hot water, then filled with 5 gals of water (which is basically full!) and added 1/3 cup of One Step (i.e. 1 tbsp per gal = 5 tbsp = 1/3 cup).  left connects and dip tube in.  added the transfer siphon tubing i'll using coming from the fermenter as well.
  
        + started by sampling at the ball valve.  super murky down there. kept it closed.
  
        + then went to the spigot.  murky at first as well, got better with time.  spigot barb too thin for the tubing, so i held it there manually.  drained down to the spigot line (slow flow with tubing down to base of keg) and tilted a bit to get more until became murky again.
  
      + **Carbonation & Dispensing**
  
        + on 7/20 I initially put the keg in the kegerator and left pressure where it sat naturally after purging and filling the headspace - ~12 psi.
  
        + Per "How to Keg" (see below), on 7/21 I turned pressure down to 10 psi by turning the set screw very loose, partially depressurizing the keg, and then tightening the set screw until i hit ~10 psi.
  
        + I also have jostled the keg every now and again.
  
        + I'm also a little concerned the kegerator is way too cold.
  
          + OH NO IT WAS WAY TOO COLD - like, freezing.  like a freezer.
  
          + did my beer freeze? it's possible.  i really hope not.
  
          + there's a setting knob on the back that goes from 1-6 and it was basically at 6.  I turned it down to 2, opened the door to equilibrate a bit, then closed.  Will check until its at 32.
  
            + {{< logseq/mark >}}UPDATE{{< / logseq/mark >}}: Using a Govee hygrometer, I know now that the inside temp is around 37F, which is pretty close to perfect (~34-35 may be ideal).
  
              + I have the dial on back of the unit set to ~1, pretty much as low as it goes as far as I can tell.
  
              + the thermometer it came with reads wrong - says it's 20F when Govee says 37F.  Makes me WAY less worried that my beer was freezing in there, I think the janked thermometer misrepresented the temp.  Though, I do still think it was probably significantly lower than it should have been, and would have been a huge electricity drain.
  
        + **Cleaning and Resetting the beer lines**
  
          + Went to Oak Barrel - they dissuaded me from getting a manual beer line cleaning pump/system and instead push percarb+water then hot water from a corny keg through the system.
  
          + I emptied, cleaned, and sterilized my other corny keg, let it sit in 5 gal warm water plus One Step, then pushed that through both tap lines, enough to fill our biggest saucepan from each tap.  completely cleared the lines of any gunk, residue, etc.  Then purged both with hot water.  sprayed StarSan up the faucet nozzle for each, and put in stoppers.
  
        + **Tapping the Kolsch**
  
          + After cleaning/purging the lines, I connected the Kolsch keg (to the RIGHT tap line) and purged the line with beer.  Was yeasty, initially.  Cleared up some but hard to say how much.
  
            + Hoping very much that another couple of days sitting in the cold will ensure the yeast have settled properly. I've been swirling it each day to encourage carbonation, and I had just moved it back into the kegerator before the purge and pour, so it's highly likely things were significantly agitated.
  
            + should i consider using a shorter dip tube?  what are some ways I could either avoid getting so much into the keg or avoid pulling it out during dispensing?
  
              + i looked into this.
  
              + **cold crash**. seem super easy, but requires a fridge.  could use kegerator if willing to disconnect and pull kegs for 1-2 days during the crash.  likely only an option with the new 30L fermentor.
  
              + **trimming the dip tube** is something people do, but there are mixed opinions about the necessity.  many claim the beer goes clear after the first pour (and stays that way until near the last pour), and that cold temp settles and compacts the sediment well enough that it's not an issue even with full-length dip tubes
  
              + **gelatin** could be a useful substitute for or addition to cold crashing.  dissolve gelatin as prescribe before kegging, add early in kegging process.  could also be done at secondary ferment step.
  
      + 
  
    + 
  
  + ## üç∫ DR Brew **25.002**: Oak Barrel [Blonde Ale](https://oakbarrel.com/ingredient-kit-blonde-ale/)
  
    + New things to try based on 25.001:
  
      + consider trimming the dip tube in the keg and/or adding gelatin to the keg when transferring the fermented beer.  should help sediment yeast (etc), and a shorter dip tube may avoid much of that anyway.
  
      + 
  
      +

## Misc
  
  + ### Tips & Tricks
  
    + **Reagent & Consumable Storage**
  
      + Extract
  
        + The lady at Oak Barrel (who is extremely helpful and knowledgeable) told me that liquid extract should be used promptly or else refrigerated, as it may begin to ferment.
  
      + Hops
  
        + Keep them cold at least, if not frozen.
  
    + **Fermentation**
  
      + Useful notion I hadn't considered (from Hazy & Hoppy): "Actively fermenting beer can be 10 degrees higher in the fermentation vessel than the ambient temperature of the room. So if your brewhouse or seemingly cool basement is 70¬∞F your beer¬†*could*¬†be¬†**80¬∞F during active fermentation**. This is the point of no return that is going to yield a lot of nasty esters that will even take over a clean ale yeast. The whole¬†*‚Äúmy basement is about 68¬∞F‚Äù*¬†school of thought is not always reliable, especially in the summer."
  
        + Take pains not to let the temp get too hot - that's where the esters come from, and that's likely where your problem is.
  
        + At a minimum, the cold towel wrap will be helpful.
  
        + **Off-flavors often associated with uncontrolled fermentation temps:**
  
          + **Fusel alcohols:**¬†Often perceived as a hot alcoholic taste that almost tastes boozy or vodka-like This tends to fade during conditioning.
  
          + **Esters:**¬†Often perceived as fruity, banana, pear, or nail polish remover.¬†While some esters are desirable in certain styles like hefeweizens, they often hit you over the head when they aren‚Äôt supposed to be there. Esters can subside during conditioning, although excessive amounts may never improve with time.
  
          + **Acetaldehyde:**¬†Often perceived as green apples, raw pumpkin or squash, or Jolly Ranchers. Acetaldehyde is a natural byproduct of every fermentation however it can present itself in excessive amounts in uncontrolled conditions.
  
    + **Yeast**
  
      + Pitching Temp - pitch colder than usual!  Biologically, doesn't make sense to pitch at 80F - you want to pitch at fermentation temp!  Get wort down to ~65-70 before adding yeast.
  
  + ### Resources
  
    + I really like the [Hazy and Hoppy](https://hazyandhoppy.com/) blog - excellent advice, clear guidance, links to products and other references, etc.
